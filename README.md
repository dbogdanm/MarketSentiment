## Introduction

The Market Sentiment Dashboard is designed to offer a consolidated and intelligent view of the prevailing mood in the financial markets. It achieves this by:

1.  **Aggregating:** Systematically collecting news articles from a diverse range of reputable financial sources.
2.  **Analyzing:** Employing an advanced AI model (Azure DeepSeek via Azure AI Services) to process the aggregated news, generating a unique Fear & Greed Index and a concise sentiment summary.
3.  **Integrating:** Fetching the latest VIX (Volatility Index) data to complement the sentiment analysis.
4.  **Persisting:** Storing historical sentiment data (F&G, VIX, AI summary, timestamps) within a robust PostgreSQL database for trend analysis.
5.  **Visualizing:** Presenting these insights through an intuitive Flask-powered web dashboard, featuring an F&G gauge, VIX display, interactive historical charts, and a recent activity table.

This tool empowers users to quickly gauge market undercurrents, backed by data and AI.

## Getting Started: Setup & Deployment

Follow these steps to get the Market Sentiment Dashboard running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   PostgreSQL server installed and running.
*   Git installed.
*   API keys for NewsAPI and Azure AI Services.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd your-repository-name # Navigate to the project root
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate

    # macOS / Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *(We use `.venv` as a common name, but your `.venv1` is also fine; adjust paths accordingly.)*

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file. If not, create one from the installed packages in your development environment (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Database Configuration

1.  **Connect to your PostgreSQL instance.**
2.  **Create a new database:** e.g., `market_sentiment_db`.
3.  **Create a dedicated user** and grant it necessary privileges on the new database.
4.  **Execute the DDL to create the `sentiment_history` table:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE sentiment_history (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        fear_greed INTEGER,
        vix REAL, -- Or NUMERIC(5, 2) for fixed precision
        summary_text TEXT
    );
    -- Optional: Index for faster querying on timestamp
    CREATE INDEX idx_sentiment_history_timestamp ON sentiment_history (timestamp DESC);
    ```

### Environment Configuration

1.  **Create an Environment File:** In the project root directory (e.g., `ProiectMarketSentimentMDS`), create a file named `.env`.
2.  **Populate `.env` with your credentials:**
    ```dotenv
    # .env example
    NEWSAPI_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_NEWSAPI_KEY"
    AZURE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_AZURE_AI_KEY"

    DB_NAME="market_sentiment_db"
    DB_USER="your_db_user"
    DB_PASS="your_db_password"
    DB_HOST="localhost" # Or your PostgreSQL server address
    # DB_PORT="5432" # Optional, if not default

    # Ensure these match your Azure AI model deployment if not hardcoded
    # AZURE_ENDPOINT_URL="YOUR_AZURE_MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL"
    # MODEL_NAME="YOUR_AZURE_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"
    ```
3.  **Security:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commitment of sensitive credentials.

## Running the Application

The application involves a data pipeline (scraping and analysis) and a web dashboard.

### Data Pipeline Execution

The data pipeline can be run manually or automatically using the provided scheduler.

*   **Manual Execution (for testing or initial run):**
    1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
    2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
    3.  Execute the scraper:
        ```bash
        python website/crucialPys/webScrape.py
        ```
    4.  Once completed, execute the analyzer:
        ```bash
        python website/crucialPys/analyze_news.py
        ```

*   **Automated Execution (Recommended):**
    1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
    2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
    3.  Run the Python-based scheduler:
        ```bash
        python scheduler_main.py
        ```
    This script will run continuously in the terminal, executing `webScrape.py` and `analyze_news.py` sequentially at 30-minute intervals (configurable in `scheduler_main.py`). Log files will be generated in the `scheduler_logs` directory. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the scheduler.

### Launching the Web Dashboard

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory (or the `website` subdirectory, depending on how your `appFlask.py` is structured for imports, but running from root is generally safer if paths are relative).
3.  Start the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    python website/appFlask.py
    ```
    *(If `appFlask.py` is in the root, use `python appFlask.py`)*
4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the URL displayed in the terminal).

### Automated Scheduling (Recommended)

For continuous, unattended operation (while your PC is on), use the `scheduler_main.py` script as described above. This script handles the periodic execution of the data pipeline.
No worries regarding API limits, the most limited API(NewsAPI) still has 100 free calls/day, running that scheduler every 30 minutes means that you've made 48 API calls.
---

## Key Configuration Points

Fine-tune the application's behavior by adjusting parameters in the respective Python scripts:

*   **API Keys & Database Credentials:** Managed via the `.env` file.
*   **News Sources (`webScrape.py`):** Modify `NEWSAPI_SOURCES` and `ALL_RSS_FEEDS` lists.
*   **Financial Tickers (`webScrape.py`):** Adjust the `YAHOO_TICKERS` list.
*   **AI Model Configuration (`analyze_news.py`):** Update `AZURE_ENDPOINT_URL` and `MODEL_NAME` (your Azure deployment name), or ensure they are loaded from environment variables.
*   **File Paths & Output (`webScrape.py`, `analyze_news.py`):** Constants like `OUTPUT_DIR`, `JSON_NEWS_FILE_PATH` are defined at the top of these scripts.
*   **Scheduling Interval (`scheduler_main.py`):** Modify the `schedule.every(...).minutes.do(...)` line.

## Roadmap & Potential Enhancements

This project serves as a strong foundation. Future enhancements could include:

*   **Advanced Error Handling & Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging using Python's `logging` module across all scripts.
*   **Real-time Intraday VIX:** Investigate robust methods (e.g., Selenium, Playwright, or specialized APIs) for more frequent VIX updates, while being mindful of source limitations and script fragility.
*   **Enhanced Data Visualization:** Introduce date range selectors for charts, more detailed tooltips, and potentially new chart types.
*   **User Authentication & Personalization:** Allow users to create accounts, save preferences, or track specific assets.
*   **Nuanced Sentiment Scoring:** Explore advanced NLP models or techniques for multi-dimensional sentiment analysis (e.g., positivity, negativity, uncertainty, specific emotions).
*   **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Utilize `asyncio` and `aiohttp` in `webScrape.py` to potentially accelerate news aggregation.
*   **Containerization (Docker):** Package the application and its dependencies into Docker containers for simplified deployment and portability.
*   **Alerting System:** Notify userspeasants (e.g., via email) of significant sentiment shifts or data pipeline failures.
